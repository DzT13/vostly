# Phase 1 Foundation Progress

## Overview
- Initialized Next.js 15 app with TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, ESLint, and app router.
- Configured project metadata, navigation layout, and shared configuration constants.
- Established Prisma ORM with SQLite datasource, manual migration SQL, and generated client.
- Implemented placeholder UI components and routed pages aligning with specification structure (dashboard, editor, settings).
- Added validation schemas (Zod) and base AI client abstractions to prepare for later phases.

## Project Structure Highlights
- `src/app` contains root layout, dashboard, editor pages (`/editor/new`, `/editor/[id]`), and settings route.
- `src/components` includes `PostList`, `PostEditor`, `AIAssistant`, `AnalysisPanel`, `AIProviderSettings`, and layout navigation.
- `src/lib` houses Prisma client helper, domain types, validators, AI client abstraction, and config constants.
- `prisma/` folder defines schema and manually created `0001_init` migration with supporting SQL.

## Database Setup
- Prisma schema models: `Post`, `AnalysisResult`, `ChatMessage`, `AIProviderSettings`.
- Manual migration SQL executed via `prisma db execute` to create tables and indices.
- Prisma client generated successfully (v6.16.1) with output to default `node_modules/@prisma/client`.
- `.env` configured with absolute SQLite path for reliability and default app name.

## API Routes Implemented
- `/api/posts` for list/create and `/api/posts/[id]` for fetch/update/delete with validation.
- `/api/analysis` & `/api/analysis/[postId]` for analysis history CRUD helpers.
- `/api/chat` & `/api/chat/[id]` for chat message persistence.
- `/api/ai-providers` & `/api/ai-providers/[id]` for provider management scaffolding.

## UI & UX Scaffolding
- Responsive layout with header navigation, footer, and content container.
- Dashboard displays quick actions and recent posts via `PostList` component.
- Editor placeholder communicates upcoming features while wiring Prisma fetch.
- Settings page lists providers and explains forthcoming functionality.

## Tooling & Scripts
- Updated `package.json` scripts (`dev`, `build`, `lint`, `db:migrate`, `db:generate`).
- Enhanced `.gitignore` for SQLite artifacts, editors, and generated Prisma directory.

## Outstanding Items
- Prisma `migrate deploy` currently fails with provider mismatch despite lock file update (see dedicated note).
- No automated tests yet; basic lint/build still pending due to Prisma migration blocker.
- Future phases will flesh out editor interactions, AI workflows, and settings CRUD.
